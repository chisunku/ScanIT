# ScanIT

This Android app is a potent tool made to transform the way customers shop. It helps customers to swiftly and easily identify the things 
they want to buy without having to actively search for them or rely on the assistance of store workers thanks to superior barcode scanning 
technology.
The goal of this project is to develop an Android smartphone application that can scan product barcodes and give customers a list of online 
retailers where the product is sold, along with each retailer's price. The software also contains features including the ability to add 
items to a shopping cart or favorites list, display data analytics from well-known retailers, integrate ChatGPT for product recommendations,
and create a TO-DO list for upcoming purchases. The software makes use of SQLite for local storage, Firebase for managing a central database,
and Rapid API to fetch a list of retail locations.
